## What is image governance?

Image governance is the systematic management of image assets — their rights,
attribution, usage permissions and lifecycle — across an organisation. It sits at the
intersection of legal compliance, brand management and technical infrastructure.

Without governance, organisations face:

- **Legal risk** — using images without proper licensing
- **Brand dilution** — inconsistent visual identity across channels
- **Attribution failure** — creators unpaid or uncredited
- **Storage waste** — duplicate assets across disconnected systems

## The governance stack

Effective image governance requires three layers:

### 1. Policy

Written guidelines covering: who can upload images, what metadata must be present,
how long assets are retained, and who approves usage in external channels.

### 2. Workflow

Automated pipelines that enforce policy: metadata validation on upload, rights-expiry
alerts, approval workflows for high-risk usage (advertising, press).

### 3. Technology

Tools that embed, read and verify metadata at every stage of the asset lifecycle —
from camera to CMS to archive.

## Who needs this?

Any organisation managing more than a few hundred images across multiple people or
platforms. Agencies, publishers, e-commerce brands and public-sector bodies all
benefit from structured governance.

## What this pillar covers

1. What is image governance — a definition for non-technical stakeholders
2. How agencies protect brand and credit at scale
3. Why DAM systems fail without structured context
4. Bring-your-own-cloud vs centralised storage for image assets
