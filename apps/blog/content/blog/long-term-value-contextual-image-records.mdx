## Two images, two futures

### Image A: No context

A JPEG file named `IMG_3847.jpg`. No IPTC metadata. No alt text. Sitting in a folder
called "2024 Events". Nobody remembers who took it or what event it shows.

**Value today:** Near zero. Cannot be published (no rights info). Cannot be found
(no keywords). Cannot be attributed (no creator).

### Image B: Full context

A JPEG file named `product-launch-london-2024-keynote.jpg`. IPTC fields: Creator
(Jane Smith), Copyright (© 2024 Acme Corp), Caption (CEO presenting new product
line at London ExCel, March 2024), Keywords (product-launch, keynote, London, 2024).

**Value today:** High. Can be published with proper attribution. Found instantly by
searching "London product launch". Rights are clear. Context is complete.

## The depreciation curve

Images without context depreciate rapidly:

- **Day 1:** Team members remember the context. Value is high.
- **Week 1:** Context starts to fade. "Which event was this?"
- **Month 1:** Original uploader may not remember details.
- **Year 1:** Context is effectively lost. Image is unusable.

Images **with** context maintain their value indefinitely. The metadata travels with
the file. It does not depend on human memory.

## The business case

### Avoid re-purchasing

Organisations regularly re-purchase stock photos because they cannot find (or verify
the licence for) images they already own. Structured metadata eliminates this waste.

### Reduce legal risk

When a rights dispute arises, the first question is: "Can you prove you had
permission?" Embedded rights metadata provides instant, file-level proof.

### Enable AI and automation

AI-powered search, auto-tagging and content generation all work better with
structured metadata. Your image archive becomes a training dataset for internal
tools.

### Preserve institutional memory

Staff turnover means knowledge loss. Embedded metadata is institutional memory that
does not walk out the door.
