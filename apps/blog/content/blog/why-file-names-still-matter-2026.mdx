## The file name is your first impression

Before a search engine reads your alt text, before it parses your IPTC metadata,
before it analyses the pixels — it reads the file name.

`IMG_4392.jpg` tells a search engine nothing.

`golden-retriever-brighton-beach-sunset-2025.jpg` tells it everything.

## Why file names persist

Unlike metadata (which can be stripped) and alt text (which lives in HTML), the file
name is part of the URL. It appears in:

- The image URL itself
- Browser download prompts
- File listings and search results
- CDN cache keys
- Log files and analytics

Changing a file name changes the URL, which affects caching, backlinks and search
ranking. File names are effectively **permanent** once published.

## Best practices for image file names

### Do

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `product-red-widget-front-view.jpg`
- Include the primary subject and relevant modifiers
- Keep it under 60 characters
- Use the correct file extension (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`)

### Do not

- Use spaces or underscores (harder to read in URLs)
- Use generic names (`image1.jpg`, `photo.jpg`, `hero.jpg`)
- Include dates in a non-standard format (`20251223_img.jpg`)
- Use sequential numbers (`DSC_0001.jpg`)
- Use the original camera file name

## Automation

If you manage hundreds of images, manual renaming is impractical. Use a naming
pipeline that derives file names from embedded metadata:

1. Read IPTC Headline or Title
2. Slugify it (lowercase, hyphenate, remove special characters)
3. Append a hash or sequence number for uniqueness
4. Apply the correct extension based on format

This approach ensures every image has a semantic, SEO-friendly file name without
manual intervention.
