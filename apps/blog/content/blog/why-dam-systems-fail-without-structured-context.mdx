## The DAM promise

Digital Asset Management (DAM) systems promise a single source of truth for all your
visual assets. Upload once, tag once, distribute everywhere. Search by keyword,
filter by licence, track usage across channels.

## The DAM reality

Most DAM implementations fail to deliver on this promise. The reason is not the
software — it is the data going into it.

### Garbage in, garbage out

A DAM system is only as searchable as the metadata attached to its assets. If images
are uploaded with:

- Generic file names (`IMG_0001.jpg`)
- No IPTC or XMP metadata
- No keywords or categories
- No licence information

Then the DAM becomes an expensive cloud folder. Unsearchable. Unmanageable.

### The tagging bottleneck

Many organisations plan to "tag everything later". This never happens. The backlog
grows exponentially. New images arrive faster than old images are tagged. Within
months, the DAM contains thousands of untagged assets.

## The fix: structured context at ingest

The solution is to embed metadata **before** images enter the DAM:

1. **Writer pipelines** — automated tools that embed Creator, Copyright, Caption
   and Keywords at the point of creation or import
2. **Validation gates** — reject uploads that lack required fields
3. **AI-assisted tagging** — use machine learning to suggest keywords, then have
   humans approve (never fully automated)
4. **Template enforcement** — pre-populate fields based on project, client or
   content type

## What "structured context" means

Structured context is metadata that follows a consistent schema. Not free-text
notes in a Description field, but typed, validated fields:

- `Creator: Jane Smith` (not "photo by jane")
- `Copyright: © 2026 Acme Agency` (not "acme owns this")
- `Keywords: ["product", "red", "widget", "front-view"]` (not "stuff")
- `Licence: Editorial use only, expires 2027-01-01` (not "check with legal")

When every asset follows the same schema, the DAM becomes genuinely searchable and
the governance layer can automate compliance checks.
