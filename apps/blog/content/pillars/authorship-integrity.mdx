## The creator problem

Every day millions of images are shared, reshared and repurposed across the web.
Within hours the original creator is often unknown. Social platforms strip metadata,
content management systems ignore it, and AI training pipelines consume images
wholesale without attribution.

Authorship integrity is the practice of embedding verifiable creator information
directly inside an image file so it persists no matter where that file travels.

## Why metadata is not enough on its own

Metadata fields like IPTC **Creator** and **Copyright Notice** have existed since the
1990s, yet adoption remains inconsistent. The problem is not the standard — it is the
tooling, education and enforcement around it.

Without a consistent writing pipeline, metadata is:

- Written inconsistently across teams
- Stripped silently by platforms
- Ignored by downstream consumers

## The role of AI

Generative AI has accelerated the crisis. When models produce photorealistic images,
the question "who made this?" becomes existential for photographers, illustrators and
agencies. Embedded provenance data — including C2PA manifests — offers a tamper-evident
chain of custody that algorithms alone cannot provide.

## What this pillar covers

The posts in this cluster explore the practical side of authorship integrity:

1. How images lose their creator identity within hours
2. The difference between credit and provenance
3. Why social platforms strip metadata — and what you can do about it
4. The hidden risk of uploading client images without context
