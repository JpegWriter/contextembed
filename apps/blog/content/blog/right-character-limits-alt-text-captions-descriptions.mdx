## Alt text

### Purpose

Describes the image for screen readers and search engines. It replaces the image
when it cannot be displayed.

### Recommended length

**80–125 characters.** Screen readers handle longer text but users lose patience.
Google truncates alt text in search results at approximately 125 characters.

### Guidelines

- Describe what the image **shows**, not what it **is** ("a sunset over the Thames"
  not "a beautiful photo")
- Do not start with "Image of" or "Photo of" — the screen reader already announces
  it as an image
- Include relevant keywords naturally
- Leave alt text empty (`alt=""`) for purely decorative images

## Captions

### Purpose

Visible text below (or alongside) the image. Read by sighted users. Provides
context that the image alone does not convey.

### Recommended length

**1–2 sentences (under 200 characters).** Captions should add information, not
repeat the alt text.

### Guidelines

- Use captions for context: who, where, when, why
- Credit the creator if not credited elsewhere
- Captions can include opinions or editorial voice — alt text should not

## Descriptions

### Purpose

In WordPress, the Description field maps to `post_content` on the attachment post.
It is rarely displayed on the front end but can be used by themes, plugins and
search engines.

### Recommended length

**Up to 500 characters.** This is your space for extended context: licence terms,
usage restrictions, detailed scene descriptions.

### Guidelines

- Use for information that does not belong in alt text or captions
- Include copyright and licensing details
- Include location, date and technical details if relevant
- This field is ideal for mapping from IPTC Copyright Notice
