## Two approaches to alt text

### AI-generated

Services like Azure Computer Vision, Google Cloud Vision and various WordPress
plugins automatically generate alt text by analysing the image pixels:

> "A dog standing on a sandy surface near water"

### Structured (from metadata)

Alt text derived from embedded IPTC fields — written by the photographer or editor
at the point of creation:

> "Golden retriever playing in the waves at Brighton beach, August 2025"

## The comparison

| Factor | AI-Generated | Structured |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Accuracy | Generic, often vague | Specific, contextual |
| Consistency | Varies between runs | Identical every time |
| Cost | API call per image | Zero (already embedded) |
| Latency | 200-500ms per image | Instant (file read) |
| Brand voice | None | Writer-controlled |
| Accessibility | Adequate | Superior |
| SEO value | Moderate | High |

## When AI-generated alt text makes sense

- Legacy archives with thousands of untagged images
- User-generated content where manual tagging is impractical
- As a **fallback** when no structured alt text exists

## When structured alt text is better

- Professional content where accuracy matters
- SEO-sensitive pages where keyword specificity drives traffic
- Accessibility-critical applications (government, education)
- Brand-controlled publishing where tone and terminology must be consistent

## The hybrid approach

The best strategy combines both: use structured alt text from IPTC metadata as the
primary source, and fall back to AI-generated text only when no metadata exists.
This gives you accuracy where you have invested in metadata, and coverage where
you have not.
