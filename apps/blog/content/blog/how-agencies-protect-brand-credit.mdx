## The agency challenge

A mid-size digital agency manages images for twenty clients. Each client has
different brand guidelines, licensing terms and attribution requirements. Images
flow between designers, content managers, social media teams and clients.

Without governance, things go wrong:

- A designer uses a stock photo whose licence has expired
- A social media manager publishes an image without the required credit
- A client's logo appears in the wrong aspect ratio on a third-party site
- An image licensed for "editorial use only" appears in an advertisement

## The governance toolkit

### 1. Ingest controls

Every image entering the agency's system must carry minimum metadata:

- Creator name
- Copyright holder
- Licence type and expiry
- Usage restrictions

Images without this metadata are quarantined, not published.

### 2. Metadata templates

Pre-built templates for each client ensure consistent field population:

```
Creator: [Photographer Name]
Copyright: © 2026 [Client Name]
Usage Terms: Licensed for web and social media only
Client: [Client ID]
Project: [Project Code]
```

### 3. Automated validation

Before any image is published, an automated check verifies:

- All required metadata fields are present
- The licence has not expired
- The usage context matches the licence terms
- The image resolution meets the channel requirements

### 4. Audit trails

Every action — upload, edit, publish, share — is logged with a timestamp, user and
description. When a client asks "who published this image and when?", the answer is
one query away.

## The cultural shift

Technology alone is not enough. Governance requires a cultural shift:

- Designers must see metadata as part of their deliverable
- Project managers must include metadata time in project plans
- Account managers must educate clients on providing proper image context
- Leadership must treat image governance as a risk management function, not an
  overhead cost
