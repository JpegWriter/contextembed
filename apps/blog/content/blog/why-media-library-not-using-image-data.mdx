## What WordPress reads

When you upload an image, WordPress extracts a small subset of EXIF data:

- Camera make and model
- Aperture, shutter speed, ISO
- Focal length
- Date taken
- GPS coordinates (if present)

This data is stored in `wp_postmeta` and displayed in the media library detail view
under "EXIF Data".

## What WordPress ignores

WordPress does **not** read or display:

- **IPTC Creator** — the photographer's name
- **IPTC Copyright Notice** — the rights holder
- **IPTC Caption/Abstract** — the editorial description
- **IPTC Headline** — the title
- **IPTC Keywords** — relevant search terms
- **XMP Rights** — usage permissions
- **XMP Description** — an alternative to IPTC Caption

These fields are present in the uploaded file. WordPress simply does not look for
them.

## Why this happens

WordPress was designed as a blogging platform, not a digital asset management system.
Its media library was built to handle user-uploaded images with minimal friction.
Reading and mapping complex metadata standards was never a priority.

The EXIF data it does read is handled by PHP's built-in `exif_read_data()` function,
which does not support IPTC or XMP natively. Reading IPTC requires `iptcparse()`,
which exists in PHP but is not used by WordPress core.

## The impact

For a personal blog, this is a minor inconvenience. For a professional publisher, an
agency or an e-commerce site, it means:

- Thousands of images with empty alt text
- Creator information invisible to editors
- Copyright data buried in binary metadata that no one reads
- SEO opportunities missed on every image

## Closing the gap

The fix is straightforward: read IPTC/XMP at upload time and map fields to the
WordPress media library. This can be done with a plugin, a custom function, or a
service like ContextEmbed that automates the entire pipeline.
