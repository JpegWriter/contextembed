## AI does not look at images the way you do

When a human sees a photograph of a dog on a beach, they understand the scene
instantly. When an AI system encounters the same image, it relies on multiple
signals to classify and understand it:

1. **Visual features** — pixel analysis, object detection, scene classification
2. **Alt text** — the text alternative provided in HTML
3. **Surrounding text** — paragraphs, headings and captions near the image
4. **File name** — `golden-retriever-beach-sunset.jpg` vs `IMG_4392.jpg`
5. **Embedded metadata** — IPTC caption, keywords, title
6. **Structured data** — JSON-LD schema connecting the image to entities

An AI-ready image provides strong signals on **all six channels** so that any system
— search engine, training pipeline, accessibility tool — can correctly interpret it.

## The AI-readiness checklist

- [ ] File name is semantic and hyphenated
- [ ] Alt text is written (not generated) and under 125 characters
- [ ] IPTC Caption/Description is populated
- [ ] IPTC Keywords contain relevant terms
- [ ] IPTC Creator and Copyright are populated
- [ ] The page includes JSON-LD ImageObject schema
- [ ] The image is served at an appropriate resolution (not upscaled)

## Why this matters now

Google's Search Generative Experience (SGE) and similar AI-powered search tools
select images based on metadata quality. Images with rich, consistent metadata
are more likely to appear in AI-generated answers, featured snippets and knowledge
panels.

The investment in metadata today directly affects your visibility in AI-powered
search tomorrow.
