## The scenario

An agency receives 200 product images from a client. The images have generic file
names (`IMG_0001.jpg` to `IMG_0200.jpg`), no IPTC metadata, and no accompanying
usage agreement beyond an email that says "here are the images, go ahead and use
them".

The agency uploads them to their CMS, publishes them across three channels, and
moves on to the next project.

Six months later, the client asks: "Can you prove those images were licensed for
social media use?"

The agency cannot. The email is buried. The images carry no rights metadata. The
CMS has no record of the licence terms.

## The compounding risk

This scenario plays out thousands of times a day across agencies worldwide. The
risks compound:

### Legal risk

Without embedded rights metadata, the agency cannot prove it had permission to use
an image in a specific context. If the image contains third-party intellectual
property (logos, artwork, recognisable people), the liability is significant.

### Reputational risk

If a client image is misattributed, used beyond its licence, or appears in an
inappropriate context, the agency's reputation suffers — even if the mistake was
the client's.

### Operational risk

When staff leave, institutional knowledge of "which images we can use where"
leaves with them. Without structured metadata, the knowledge is unrecoverable.

## The fix

1. **Require metadata on ingest** — do not accept images without at minimum Creator
   and Copyright Notice
2. **Embed usage terms** — write IPTC Rights Usage Terms before publishing
3. **Log every upload** — maintain an audit trail linking images to licence agreements
4. **Validate before publish** — automated checks that reject images missing required fields
