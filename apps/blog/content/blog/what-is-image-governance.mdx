## A definition

Image governance is the set of policies, workflows and technologies that ensure
every image used by an organisation is properly licensed, attributed, and managed
throughout its lifecycle.

It answers four questions:

1. **Who created this image?** — Attribution
2. **Who owns the rights?** — Licensing
3. **Where can it be used?** — Permissions
4. **How long can we keep it?** — Retention

## Why organisations need it

### Legal compliance

Using an image without a valid licence is copyright infringement. In many
jurisdictions, statutory damages apply even when the infringement was unintentional.
A single unlicensed stock photo can cost thousands.

### Brand consistency

Without governance, teams use images inconsistently — wrong aspect ratios, outdated
branding, off-brand stock photos. Governance ensures visual consistency across
every channel.

### Creator rights

Photographers, illustrators and designers deserve proper attribution. Governance
ensures creator metadata travels with the image and is surfaced wherever the image
appears.

### Operational efficiency

When anyone can upload anything to the CMS without metadata requirements, the media
library becomes a dumping ground. Governance provides structure: naming conventions,
required fields, folder hierarchies, and expiry rules.

## The governance maturity model

| Level | Description | Characteristics |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| 0 — Ad hoc | No formal process | Images uploaded by anyone, no metadata, no audit trail |
| 1 — Documented | Written guidelines | Naming conventions and metadata requirements exist but are not enforced |
| 2 — Enforced | Automated checks | Upload pipelines reject images without required metadata |
| 3 — Measured | KPIs and reporting | Metadata completeness rates tracked, audit reports generated |
| 4 — Optimised | Continuous improvement | Feedback loops, AI-assisted tagging, provenance verification |

Most organisations sit at Level 0 or 1. The goal of this pillar is to get you to
Level 2 and beyond.
