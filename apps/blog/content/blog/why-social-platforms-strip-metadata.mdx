## It is not malice — it is engineering

When Instagram strips EXIF GPS data from your uploaded photo, it is not trying to
erase your authorship. It is trying to protect your location privacy. When Twitter/X
re-encodes your JPEG, it is optimising for bandwidth and storage. The metadata loss
is a side effect, not a goal.

But the result is the same: creator information is destroyed.

## What gets stripped and why

### GPS and location data

Almost every platform strips EXIF GPS coordinates. This is a **privacy** decision —
users often do not realise their photos contain precise location data.

### Camera and device data

Some platforms strip EXIF Make, Model and Serial Number fields. This is partly
privacy (device fingerprinting) and partly to reduce file size.

### Creator and rights fields

IPTC Creator, Copyright Notice and XMP Rights are stripped by most social platforms.
This is usually a side effect of image re-encoding — the platform generates a new
file and does not copy non-visual metadata.

## The re-encoding problem

Social platforms do not serve your original file. They:

1. Decode the uploaded image
2. Resize it to platform-specific dimensions
3. Re-encode it (often as WebP or lower-quality JPEG)
4. Serve the new file

Step 3 is where metadata dies. The re-encoder writes a clean file with no IPTC,
no XMP, and minimal EXIF (if any).

## What creators can do

- Accept that social-platform copies will lose metadata
- Focus on preserving metadata in **source** files and **owned** platforms
- Use Content Credentials (C2PA) which some platforms are beginning to preserve
- Add visible attribution (watermarks, overlays) as a fallback
- Publish canonical versions on platforms you control (your own site, blog)
