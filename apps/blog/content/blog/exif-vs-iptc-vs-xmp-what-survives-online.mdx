## Three standards, one messy history

Image metadata did not start as a unified system. It grew in layers:

### EXIF (1995)

Exchangeable Image File Format. Created by camera manufacturers to store technical
shooting data. Think shutter speed, aperture, ISO, GPS, date taken.

**Strengths:** universally written by cameras.
**Weaknesses:** no rights fields, no editorial fields, limited to specific data types.

### IPTC IIM (1991, updated)

International Press Telecommunications Council. Designed for news photography.
Stores editorial data: headline, caption, creator, copyright, keywords.

**Strengths:** widely supported by photo editors and agencies.
**Weaknesses:** fixed field lengths, binary format, harder to extend.

### XMP (2001)

Extensible Metadata Platform by Adobe. XML-based, unlimited extensibility. Can
store anything IPTC can plus custom schemas.

**Strengths:** extensible, human-readable, supports complex rights expressions.
**Weaknesses:** not universally written by cameras, larger file overhead.

## The overlap problem

IPTC and XMP overlap significantly. Both can store Creator, Copyright, Caption and
Keywords. When they disagree, tools handle the conflict differently:

- **Lightroom** writes both IPTC and XMP, keeping them in sync
- **Photoshop** prefers XMP but reads IPTC
- **ExifTool** lets you read and write any field independently

The safest approach: write both IPTC and XMP, let EXIF handle the camera data, and
validate that all three agree before publishing.

## Survival by standard

In our testing, XMP was the most reliably preserved by modern tools and platforms,
followed by IPTC, with EXIF camera data being the most frequently stripped.
