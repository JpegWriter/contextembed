## What Google reads

Google has confirmed it uses the following signals for image search ranking:

1. **Alt text** — the primary textual signal for image content
2. **Page title and headings** — context around the image
3. **File name** — semantic file names improve understanding
4. **Caption text** — visible text near the image
5. **Image sitemap data** — structured information about images

What Google has **not** confirmed (but evidence suggests it reads):

- IPTC metadata in JPEG files
- XMP data in JPEG and PNG files
- EXIF data (primarily for date and location)

## The structured data advantage

JSON-LD `ImageObject` schema provides explicit, machine-readable context:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "ImageObject",
  "name": "Golden retriever on Brighton beach at sunset",
  "description": "A golden retriever playing in the waves...",
  "contentUrl": "https://example.com/images/golden-retriever-beach.jpg",
  "creator": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Jane Smith"
  },
  "copyrightHolder": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Jane Smith"
  },
  "dateCreated": "2025-08-15"
}
```

This structured data reinforces the signals from alt text and metadata, giving
search engines high confidence in their understanding of the image.

## Bing and other engines

Bing Visual Search reads embedded metadata more aggressively than Google. IPTC
Creator and Copyright fields appear in Bing Image Search results for properly
tagged images.

DuckDuckGo relies primarily on alt text and page context, with limited metadata
parsing.

## Practical recommendations

1. Always write alt text — it is the highest-signal channel
2. Use semantic file names — they are the second-highest signal
3. Embed IPTC metadata — it reinforces alt text and helps Bing
4. Add JSON-LD ImageObject — it is the most explicit signal available
5. Include images in your XML sitemap with `<image:image>` tags
