## Images are data now

Search engines no longer just index the text around an image — they read the image
itself, its metadata, its alt text, and even its file name. AI systems go further,
using all available context to classify, caption and retrieve visual content.

An "AI-ready" image is one that carries enough structured context to be correctly
understood without any surrounding page content.

## The four layers of image context

1. **File name** — a semantic, hyphenated description (`london-skyline-sunset-2025.jpg`)
2. **Alt text** — a concise, human-readable description for accessibility and SEO
3. **Embedded metadata** — IPTC/XMP fields providing creator, rights, keywords and captions
4. **Structured data** — JSON-LD on the page connecting the image to its context

When all four layers align, search engines and AI systems receive consistent,
reinforcing signals about what the image depicts and who created it.

## Why most images fail

Most images published today carry at best one of these four layers — usually a
hastily written alt attribute. The file name is often `IMG_4392.jpg`. The metadata
was stripped during upload. There is no structured data.

This pillar explores how to close those gaps.

## What this pillar covers

1. What makes an image AI-ready
2. How search engines interpret image metadata
3. Structured vs generated alt text — which performs better
4. Why file names still matter in 2026
