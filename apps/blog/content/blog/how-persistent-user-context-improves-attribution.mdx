## The manual attribution problem

In most workflows, attribution is a manual step. A photographer finishes editing,
opens the metadata panel, and types their name, copyright notice, and contact
details. Every single time.

This leads to:

- **Inconsistency** — "Jane Smith" vs "J. Smith" vs "Smith, Jane"
- **Omission** — forgot to fill it in before exporting
- **Errors** — typos, wrong copyright year, outdated contact info

## What is persistent user context?

Persistent user context is a stored profile of metadata defaults that are
automatically applied to every image processed through a pipeline. Once configured,
it works silently:

```yaml
profile:
  creator: "Jane Smith"
  copyright: "© {year} Jane Smith Photography"
  contact:
    email: "jane@example.com"
    website: "https://janesmith.photography"
  defaults:
    source: "Jane Smith Photography"
    credit: "Jane Smith"
```

Every image processed through the pipeline receives these fields automatically. The
photographer never types their name again.

## Benefits of persistent context

### 1. Consistency

Every image carries the same creator format, copyright structure and contact
details. No variations, no typos.

### 2. Zero effort after setup

The one-time cost of configuring the profile is amortised across every image
processed. After setup, attribution is fully automated.

### 3. Easy updates

When contact details change, update the profile once. All future images carry the
new information. (Existing images are not affected — they carry a historical record.)

### 4. Team scalability

In an agency, each team member has their own profile. The pipeline applies the
correct creator metadata based on who is processing the image.

## How ContextEmbed implements this

ContextEmbed stores user context in the application profile. During the onboarding
flow, users configure their creator details, copyright template, and default fields.
Every image processed through the pipeline inherits these defaults, ensuring every
file carries accurate, consistent attribution from the moment it is created.
