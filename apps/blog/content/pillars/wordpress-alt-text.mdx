## The WordPress metadata gap

WordPress stores image context in three media-library fields: **Alt Text**,
**Caption** and **Description**. These fields are independent of any metadata
embedded in the image file itself.

When you upload a JPEG with a carefully written IPTC caption, WordPress ignores it.
The alt text field stays empty. The caption field stays empty. All that embedded
context vanishes into the media library as if it never existed.

## Why this matters at scale

For a site with dozens of images, manual entry is tedious but manageable. For a site
with thousands — a stock library, an agency portfolio, a news archive — manual entry
is impossible. The result is thousands of images with empty alt text, harming both
accessibility and SEO.

## The solution: read-on-upload

A plugin or pipeline that reads IPTC/XMP fields at upload time and maps them to
WordPress media-library fields can eliminate this gap entirely:

| IPTC Field | WordPress Field |
|------------|----------------|
| Headline | Title |
| Description/Caption | Caption |
| Description/Caption | Alt Text (if empty) |
| Copyright Notice | Description |
| Keywords | Tags (optional) |

The mapping is configurable. The important principle is: **never leave alt text
empty when the image already carries a description**.

## What this pillar covers

1. How to auto-populate WordPress alt text from embedded metadata
2. Why the media library is not using the data already in your images
3. Should you overwrite existing alt text with metadata?
4. The right character limits for alt text, captions and descriptions
