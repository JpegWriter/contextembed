## Two models

### Centralised storage (traditional DAM)

All images live in one system — Bynder, Canto, Brandfolder, Adobe Experience Manager.
A single team controls access, tagging and distribution.

**Pros:**
- Single source of truth
- Centralised governance and access control
- Consistent metadata schema
- Audit trail in one place

**Cons:**
- Expensive licensing (per-user or per-asset)
- Vendor lock-in
- Often slow to adopt (IT procurement cycles)
- Resistance from teams who prefer their own tools

### Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)

Teams use their existing cloud storage — Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, S3 — and
a metadata layer sits on top, reading and writing metadata across all of them.

**Pros:**
- Zero new storage costs (use existing cloud accounts)
- Faster adoption (no new tool to learn)
- Flexible — teams keep their preferred workflow
- No vendor lock-in for storage

**Cons:**
- Metadata consistency requires enforcement tooling
- No built-in access control across clouds
- Audit trail must be aggregated from multiple sources
- Search requires indexing across multiple backends

## Which model is right?

### Choose centralised when:

- You have budget for a DAM licence
- Compliance requirements demand a single audit trail
- All teams are willing to adopt a new tool
- Asset volume justifies the investment (10,000+ images)

### Choose BYOC when:

- Budget is limited
- Teams are distributed and use different tools
- You need to govern existing assets without migrating them
- Speed of adoption matters more than centralised control

### Choose hybrid when:

- Critical assets (brand, product, campaign) go in the DAM
- Day-to-day working files stay in team cloud storage
- A metadata layer connects both, ensuring consistent governance

## The ContextEmbed approach

ContextEmbed takes the BYOC approach: embed metadata directly in image files stored
wherever your team already works. The governance layer reads and validates metadata
from any source — no migration required, no DAM licence needed.
