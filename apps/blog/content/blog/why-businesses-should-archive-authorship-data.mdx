## The cost of waiting

Every day you operate without embedded authorship data, you accumulate a metadata
debt. Images enter your archive without creator information, without rights data,
without context.

After a year, you might have 5,000 images with no authorship data. Retroactively
identifying the creator of each image requires:

- Searching email threads for the original delivery
- Checking contracts and invoices
- Asking team members who may have moved on
- Cross-referencing with stock photo purchase records

**Estimated time per image:** 10–30 minutes.
**Estimated cost for 5,000 images:** 800–2,500 hours of staff time.

## The cost of starting now

Embedding authorship data at the point of creation or ingest costs:

- **Zero** if automated (pipeline reads camera/editor data and writes standardised
  metadata)
- **30 seconds per image** if manual (fill in a template)

**Estimated annual cost for 5,000 images:** 40–80 hours, or zero with automation.

## The compounding value

Authorship data grows in value over time:

### Year 1
Every image has a creator. You can generate attribution reports, comply with licence
terms, and respond to rights queries instantly.

### Year 3
You have a three-year archive of fully attributed images. AI systems can learn your
organisation's visual style and attribution patterns. Insurance and legal teams have
a defensible record.

### Year 5
Your archive is a strategic asset. It proves provenance for every image you have
ever used. Competitors who did not embed authorship data from the start cannot
match this record.

## The minimum viable archive

You do not need a DAM system or a complex pipeline to start. The minimum viable
archive requires:

1. A consistent IPTC schema (Creator, Copyright, Caption, Keywords)
2. A tool to embed metadata (ExifTool, Lightroom, ContextEmbed)
3. A storage location that preserves metadata (any cloud storage)
4. A habit: never publish an image without metadata
