## Methodology

We created a reference JPEG with the following metadata fully populated:

- **EXIF:** DateTime, GPS, Make, Model, Software
- **IPTC:** Creator, Copyright, Caption, Headline, Keywords, Source
- **XMP:** Rights, Creator, Description, Subject, UsageTerms

The image was uploaded to five platforms and then downloaded (where possible) to
check which fields survived.

## Results

### Instagram

**Survived:** Nothing.
Instagram re-encodes all images, stripping every metadata field. Even EXIF
DateTime is replaced with the upload timestamp.

### Twitter/X

**Survived:** Nothing.
X strips all EXIF, IPTC and XMP data. The downloaded image is a clean re-encode.

### LinkedIn

**Survived:** Nothing.
LinkedIn behaves identically to Instagram and X. Complete metadata removal.

### WordPress (default install)

**Survived:** Everything in the original. Nothing in resized copies.
The uploaded original retains all EXIF, IPTC and XMP fields. Generated thumbnails
and intermediate sizes lose everything (GD library default).

### Google Drive

**Survived:** Everything.
Google Drive stores files as-is. No re-encoding, no metadata stripping. The
downloaded file is byte-identical to the uploaded file.

## Key findings

1. **Social platforms strip everything.** Design your workflow assuming zero metadata survival.
2. **WordPress preserves originals** but strips resized copies — and visitors see resized copies.
3. **Cloud storage preserves everything** — use it as your canonical archive.
4. **You cannot rely on any single platform** to be the custodian of your metadata.

## What to do

Maintain your own canonical, metadata-rich archive. Treat platform copies as
ephemeral. Embed your most critical data (Creator, Copyright) in every file before
it leaves your control.
