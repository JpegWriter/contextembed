## The short answer

**Partially.** WordPress preserves most embedded metadata in the original uploaded
file. But it strips metadata from the **resized copies** it generates (thumbnails,
medium, large).

## What happens at upload time

When you upload an image to WordPress:

1. The **original file** is stored in `wp-content/uploads/` with metadata intact
2. WordPress generates multiple resized versions (150×150, 300×300, 1024×1024, etc.)
3. The resized versions are created using GD or Imagick — both strip IPTC/XMP by default
4. WordPress reads a subset of EXIF data and stores it in the database

The result: the original has metadata, but every version your visitors actually see
does **not**.

## The media library gap

WordPress extracts some EXIF data (camera, aperture, date) and displays it in the
media library. But it does **not** extract:

- IPTC Creator
- IPTC Copyright Notice
- XMP Rights
- Keywords

These fields exist in the uploaded file but are invisible in the WordPress admin.

## How to fix it

### Option 1: Preserve metadata in resized images

Use the `wp_generate_attachment_metadata` filter to copy IPTC/XMP from the original
to each generated size. This requires a custom plugin or a metadata-aware image
processing library.

### Option 2: Map metadata to media fields

Read IPTC fields at upload time and populate the Alt Text, Caption and Description
fields automatically. This ensures the editorial content is surfaced even if the
image metadata is stripped.

### Option 3: Use ContextEmbed

ContextEmbed automates both approaches — preserving metadata in generated sizes
and mapping IPTC fields to WordPress media-library fields.
