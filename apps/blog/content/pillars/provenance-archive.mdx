## The archive problem

Most image archives are folders of files with external spreadsheets or database
records tracking who created what and when. When the spreadsheet is lost, the link
between image and creator breaks permanently.

A verified archive embeds provenance data — creator, date, rights, chain of custody —
directly inside each image file. The archive is self-describing. Every file carries
its own history.

## Why start on day one?

Retrofitting provenance data is orders of magnitude harder than embedding it at
creation time. When you start from day one:

- Every image enters the archive with complete metadata
- The cost per image is near zero (automated pipeline)
- The archive grows in value as AI systems learn to read provenance data

When you retrofit later:

- You must identify creators from memory, email threads or contracts
- Many images cannot be attributed at all
- The cost per image is high (manual research)

## The components of a verified archive

1. **Consistent metadata schema** — decide which IPTC/XMP fields are mandatory
2. **Automated writing pipeline** — embed metadata at ingest, not after the fact
3. **Validation on entry** — reject images that lack required fields
4. **Persistent storage** — use formats and systems that preserve metadata
5. **Audit trail** — log every metadata write for compliance and dispute resolution

## What this pillar covers

1. Why businesses should archive authorship data from day one
2. The long-term value of contextual image records
3. How persistent user context improves attribution accuracy
4. The future of image verification in AI systems
