## The conflict

You have an image with IPTC Caption: "Aerial view of the Thames at dusk". Someone
has already manually entered the WordPress alt text: "London river photo".

If you auto-populate alt text from metadata, should you overwrite the existing
value?

## Arguments for overwriting

- The IPTC caption was written by the photographer with domain expertise
- "Aerial view of the Thames at dusk" is objectively more descriptive
- Consistency is valuable — all images should follow the same pattern
- Manual alt text is often hastily written and lower quality

## Arguments against overwriting

- The manual alt text may reflect the **page context**, not just the image content
- An editor may have deliberately chosen different wording for readability
- Overwriting feels destructive — data loss is hard to reverse
- Some images have been manually tagged by accessibility specialists

## A decision framework

### Strategy 1: Fill empty only (safest)

Only populate alt text from metadata when the current field is empty. Never touch
existing values.

**Best for:** sites with significant manual alt text investment.

### Strategy 2: Fill empty, flag conflicts

Populate empty fields and flag images where metadata differs from existing alt text
for manual review.

**Best for:** sites migrating to a metadata-first workflow.

### Strategy 3: Metadata wins (aggressive)

Always overwrite with metadata values. Trust the embedded data over manual entry.

**Best for:** new sites with no existing alt text, or sites where metadata quality
is consistently higher than manual entry.

### Strategy 4: Longest wins

Compare lengths. Keep whichever value is more descriptive (longer).

**Best for:** quick heuristic when manual review is impractical.

## Recommendation

Start with Strategy 1 (fill empty only). Move to Strategy 2 once you trust your
metadata pipeline. Only use Strategy 3 if you have validated that your IPTC data
is consistently high quality.
