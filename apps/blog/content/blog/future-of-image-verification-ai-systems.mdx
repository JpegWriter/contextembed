## The authenticity crisis

In 2026, AI-generated images are photorealistic. A generated portrait is
indistinguishable from a photograph to the human eye. A generated product image
can replace a studio photoshoot. A generated news photo can fabricate an event that
never happened.

The question "is this image real?" is no longer answerable by looking at it.

## The verification stack

The industry is converging on a multi-layered approach to image verification:

### Layer 1: Embedded metadata (IPTC/XMP)

Traditional metadata fields — Creator, Copyright, Source — provide basic provenance.
They are not tamper-proof but they are widely supported and easy to implement.

### Layer 2: Content Credentials (C2PA)

The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) provides a
cryptographic manifest that records:

- Who created the image
- What tool was used (camera, editor, AI model)
- Every edit made since creation
- A hash chain proving the manifest has not been tampered with

Camera manufacturers (Leica, Sony, Nikon) and software vendors (Adobe, Microsoft)
are shipping C2PA support. This is the most promising technical standard for
image verification.

### Layer 3: Platform verification

Platforms like Google, Meta and X are beginning to label AI-generated content. This
relies on a combination of C2PA manifests, invisible watermarks (SynthID), and
classifier models that detect AI-generated patterns.

### Layer 4: Blockchain and distributed ledgers

Some systems record image hashes on a blockchain to provide immutable proof of
existence at a point in time. This is useful for timestamping but does not prove
authorship on its own.

## What this means for creators

1. **Embed metadata now** — it is the foundation for every verification layer
2. **Adopt C2PA when available** — it is becoming the industry standard
3. **Archive originals** — keep the highest-fidelity version with full provenance
4. **Maintain a verifiable chain of custody** — every handoff should be logged

## What this means for businesses

- Image governance policies must account for AI-generated content
- Procurement processes should require provenance data for purchased images
- Legal teams should understand C2PA manifests as evidence
- Publishing pipelines should verify provenance before publication

## The ContextEmbed position

ContextEmbed focuses on Layer 1 (embedded metadata) with a pathway to Layer 2
(C2PA). By building a robust metadata foundation today, your images are ready for
the verification systems of tomorrow.
