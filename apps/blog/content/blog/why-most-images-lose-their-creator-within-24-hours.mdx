## The 24-hour lifecycle of an image

A photographer takes a portrait. The camera writes EXIF data: date, GPS, device
model. Lightroom adds IPTC fields: creator name, copyright notice, caption. The
image is exported as a JPEG with all metadata intact.

Then the journey begins.

### Hour 1 — Upload to cloud storage

The photographer uploads the file to Google Drive or Dropbox. Both preserve metadata.
So far, so good.

### Hour 4 — Sent to client via email

The image is attached to an email. Email clients preserve the file as-is. Metadata
survives.

### Hour 6 — Client uploads to WordPress

WordPress reads the file but does **not** map IPTC fields to media-library fields
by default. The alt text field remains empty. The creator name is buried in metadata
that the CMS ignores.

### Hour 8 — Published on social media

The client posts the image to Instagram. Instagram strips all EXIF and IPTC metadata
during processing. The creator name is gone.

### Hour 12 — Reshared on Twitter/X

Someone screenshots the Instagram post and shares it on X. The screenshot carries
zero metadata. The original creator is now unrecoverable.

### Hour 24 — Indexed by AI

A training pipeline scrapes the tweet. The image enters a dataset with no
attribution. The photographer will never know.

## What can you do?

The answer is not to stop sharing images. It is to build pipelines that embed
metadata so deeply and consistently that even when platforms strip it, the
**next** copy retains it. Visible watermarks help. Content Credentials (C2PA) help
more. But the foundation is always structured, embedded metadata.

## Key takeaway

If you rely on external databases, spreadsheets or platform captions to track
authorship, you have already lost. The only attribution that travels with the file
is the attribution **inside** the file.
