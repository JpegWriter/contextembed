## Three standards, one image

Modern image files can carry metadata in three overlapping formats:

- **EXIF** — camera-generated data (shutter speed, GPS, date taken)
- **IPTC IIM** — editorial fields (headline, caption, creator)
- **XMP** — extensible, XML-based sidecar data (rights, keywords, custom schemas)

Most tools write a subset. Most platforms strip a subset. The gap between what gets
written and what survives is where authorship dies.

## The survival matrix

We tested a reference JPEG with fully populated EXIF, IPTC and XMP fields across
five major platforms and three CMS systems. The results were stark:

| Field | WordPress | Instagram | Twitter/X | LinkedIn | Google Drive |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| IPTC Creator | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| IPTC Copyright | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| EXIF GPS | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| XMP Rights | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

The pattern is clear: social platforms strip almost everything. File-storage platforms
preserve almost everything. CMS behaviour depends on configuration.

## Why this matters

If your publishing pipeline touches any stripping platform, the metadata you
carefully embedded may never reach your audience. Understanding the survival matrix
lets you design workflows that protect the fields that matter most.

## What this pillar covers

1. EXIF vs IPTC vs XMP — a practical comparison
2. Does WordPress preserve metadata? (It depends)
3. What happens to metadata when images are resized
4. Testing image metadata survival across five platforms
