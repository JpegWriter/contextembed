## Credit is social. Provenance is technical.

When a photographer is credited in a magazine caption — "Photo: Jane Smith" — that
is **credit**. It is a social convention, easily removed, edited or fabricated.

When the same image carries IPTC Creator, XMP Rights, a C2PA manifest and a
timestamped hash — that is **provenance**. It is technical, machine-readable and
tamper-evident.

## Why the distinction matters

Credit can be:

- Added by anyone (not just the creator)
- Changed without detection
- Lost when content is reshared

Provenance, by contrast:

- Is embedded at the point of creation
- Can be cryptographically verified
- Survives platform processing (when using C2PA)

## The spectrum

In practice, most images sit somewhere on a spectrum:

| Level | What exists | Trust level |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| None | No creator info anywhere | Zero |
| Caption credit | "Photo: Jane Smith" in surrounding text | Low |
| IPTC metadata | Creator field embedded in file | Medium |
| Full provenance | IPTC + C2PA manifest + hash chain | High |

The goal is to move every image as far right on this spectrum as your workflow
allows.

## Practical advice

1. Always embed IPTC Creator and Copyright Notice — it costs nothing
2. Use C2PA-compatible tools where available
3. Do not rely on platform captions as your only form of attribution
4. Treat credit as a nice-to-have and provenance as a must-have
