## The problem

You have spent time embedding IPTC Creator, Caption and Copyright into your images.
You upload them to WordPress. The media library ignores all of it.

Alt text: empty. Caption: empty. Description: empty.

Every image published without alt text is an accessibility failure and a missed SEO
opportunity.

## The solution

WordPress fires several hooks during the upload process. By hooking into
`wp_generate_attachment_metadata`, you can read the IPTC data from the original file
and populate the media fields automatically.

### The field mapping

| IPTC Field (2:xxx) | WordPress Field |
|--------------------|----------------|
| 2:120 Caption/Abstract | Alt Text |
| 2:105 Headline | Title |
| 2:120 Caption/Abstract | Caption |
| 2:116 Copyright Notice | Description |
| 2:025 Keywords | Tags (optional) |

### The code

```php
add_filter('wp_generate_attachment_metadata', function($metadata, $attachment_id) {
    $file = get_attached_file($attachment_id);
    $iptc = [];

    $info = [];
    getimagesize($file, $info);

    if (isset($info['APP13'])) {
        $iptc = iptcparse($info['APP13']);
    }

    // Map Caption to Alt Text
    if (!empty($iptc['2#120'][0])) {
        update_post_meta($attachment_id, '_wp_attachment_image_alt', $iptc['2#120'][0]);
    }

    // Map Headline to Title
    if (!empty($iptc['2#105'][0])) {
        wp_update_post([
            'ID' => $attachment_id,
            'post_title' => $iptc['2#105'][0],
        ]);
    }

    return $metadata;
}, 10, 2);
```

## What about existing images?

You can run a bulk operation across your media library to retroactively read IPTC
data from originals and populate empty fields. Be cautious — only populate fields
that are currently empty to avoid overwriting manual edits.

## The ContextEmbed approach

ContextEmbed automates this entire workflow with configurable field mapping, conflict
resolution and audit logging. No custom code required.
